# What is Marmot

Marmot is a distributed SQLite replicator with leaderless, and eventual consistency. It allows you to build a robust replication
between your nodes by building on top of fault-tolerant [NATS Jetsream](https://nats.io/). This means if you are running a read
heavy website based on SQLite, you should be easily able to scale it out by adding more SQLite replicated nodes. SQLite is
probably the most ubiquitous DB that exists almost everywhere, Marmot aims to make it even more ubiquitous for server
side applications by building a replication layer on top. In a typical setting Marmot can be used to distribute your
CMS, forums, etc.

## Why?

SQLite is a probably the most ubiquitous DB that exists almost everywhere, this project aims to make it even more ubiquitous for server
side applications by building a masterless replication layer on top. This means if you are running a read heavy website based on SQLite
you should be easily able to scale it out by adding more nodes of your app with SQLite replicated nodes.

## Why not others?

There are a few solutions like [rqlite](https://github.com/rqlite/rqlite), [dqlite](https://dqlite.io/), and
[LiteFS](https://github.com/superfly/litefs) etc. All of them either are layers on top of SQLite (e.g.
rqlite, dqlite) that requires them to sit in the middle with network layer in order to provide
replication; or intercept phsycial page level writes to stream them off to replicas. In both
cases they are mostly single primary where all the writes have to go, backed by multiple
replicas that can only be readonly.

Marmot on the other hand is born different. Instead of being single primary it is "masterless", instead of being strongly consistent,
it's eventually consistent, does not require any changes to your application logic for reading/writing. This means:

- You can read and write to your SQLite database like you normally do.
- You can write on any node! You don't have to go to single master for writing your data.
- As long as you start with same copy of database, all the mutations will eventually converge (hence eventually consistent).

Marmot is a CDC (Change Data Capture) pipeline running top of NATS. It can automatically confgure appropriate JetStreams making sure
those streams evenly distribute load over those shards, so scaling simply boils down to adding more nodes, and rebalancing
those JetStreams (To be automated in future versions).

## FAQ

### What happens when there is a race condition?

In Marmot every row is uniquely mapped to a JetStream. This guarantees that for any node to publish changes for a row it has to go through 
same JetStream as everyone else. If two nodes perform a change to same row in parallel, both of the nodes will compete to publish their 
change to JetStream cluster. Due to [RAFT quorum](https://docs.nats.io/running-a-nats-service/configuration/clustering/jetstream_clustering#raft) 
constraint only one of the writer will be able to get it's changes published first. Now as these changes are applied (even the publisher applies 
it's own changes to database) the **last writer** will always win. This means there is NO serializability guarantee of a transaction 
spanning multiple tables. This is a design choice, in order to avoid any sort of global locking, and performance. 

### Won't capturing changes with triggers use more disk space?

Yes it will require additional storage to old/new values from triggers. But right now that is the only way sqlite can and should allow one to capture changes. However, in a typical setting these captured changes will be picked up pretty quickly. Disk space is usually cheapest part of modern cloud.

### How do I cleanup my database?

Ask marmot to remove hooks and log tables by:
`marmot -config /path/to/config.toml -cleanup`

### How many shards should I have?

Mostly you won't need more than 1. But it depends on your usecase, and what problem you are solving for. While read scaling won't be a problem, your write throughput will depend on your network and disk speeds (Network being the biggest culprit). Shards are there to eliviate the problem when you are writing fast enough to cause bottleneck by NATS JetStream (very unlikely with a commodity SQLite node).

### Can I use Marmot as single primary and multiple replicas?

Yes you can. There are two flags in configuration that will allow you to do that. First flag `publish` enables/disables publishing local changes to NATS, you should disable `publish` (set it to `false`) on replicas. Second flag is `replicate` that enables/disables replicating changes from NATS on to local node. You should disable `replicate` (set it to `false`) on primary.
