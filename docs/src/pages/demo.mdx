title: Marmot + Isso Demo
---

## What is Marmot?

[Marmot](https://github.com/maxpert/marmot) is a distributed SQLite replicator that runs as a side-car to you service, and replicates 
data across cluster using embedded NATS. Marmot relies on [JetStream](https://docs.nats.io/nats-concepts/jetstream)
based CDC (Change Data Capture) to replicate changes. JetStream under the hood uses RAFT for consensus
and allows for eventually consistent SQLite replicas (multi-primary replication).

## What is Isso?

[Isso](https://isso-comments.de/) is a commenting system like Disqus. Users can edit or delete own
comments (within 15 minutes by default). Best part about Isso is that it uses SQLite!

## What is Fly.io?

Fly is a platform for running full stack apps and databases close to your users. Compute jobs at Fly.io are
virtualized using Firecracker, the virtualization engine developed at AWS as the
engine for Lambda and Fargate.

## Why should I care?

This demo effectively shows how Isso can be scaled out and pushed closer to the edge. Many out of box SQLite tools can be scaled 
similarly. Your fly.io nodes scale up or down based on traffic, and write from everywhere. This allows horizontal scalability
of your Isso close to the user. With NATS embedded into Marmot, a sharded RAFT is used to capture changes, and replay them 
across the fly nodes. So if you are running a single node SQLite site you can now add redundancy to that with Marmot.

## How do I configure one for myself?

You can access code and follow the instructions [here](https://gitlab.com/maxpert/marmot-denokv).
